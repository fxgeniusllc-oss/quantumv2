# Build and Test Guide

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. **Install Python Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Install Node.js Dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

### Running the System

#### Quantum Trading System

```bash
python main.py
```

This starts the main quantum trading system with:
- Multi-exchange connections (Binance, Bybit, OKX, KuCoin, Huobi, Kraken)
- Real-time market data collection
- ML-powered prediction models
- Risk management
- System monitoring

#### DeFi Strategy

```bash
python defi_main.py
```

This runs the DeFi arbitrage and flashloan strategies with:
- Multi-chain support (Ethereum, Polygon, BSC)
- Flashloan aggregation
- MEV extraction capabilities

### Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

### System Resources
- Thread pool: 32 concurrent workers
- Monitoring interval: 5-10 seconds (configurable)
- Trade execution: Sub-second response time

## Security

- ✅ Military-grade Fernet encryption for credentials
- ✅ Hardware-based key generation
- ✅ Secure file permissions (600) on sensitive files
- ✅ Environment variable isolation
- ✅ Encrypted vault storage
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets

## Configuration

See `.env.example` for all required environment variables:
- Exchange API keys and secrets
- Blockchain RPC endpoints
- Private keys for DeFi operations
- Risk parameters
- System configuration

```

## Architecture Compliance

All modules from the README architecture are implemented:

```
✅ quantum_market_domination/
   ✅ core/ (config_manager, secret_vault, system_monitor)
   ✅ data_acquisition/ (quantum_collector)
   ✅ intelligence/ml_models/ (price_predictor, volatility_model, anomaly_detector)
   ✅ execution/ (trade_executor, risk_manager)
   ✅ monitoring/
   ✅ utils/ (encryption)

✅ ultimate-defi-domination/
   ✅ core/ (config, secrets)
   ✅ engines/python_engine/ (strategy_engine)
   ✅ engines/node_engine/ (tx_executor.js)
   
✅ contracts/ (flashloan_aggregator.sol)
```

## Next Steps

1. **Configure Environment**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your credentials
2. **Test in Development**: Run with `ENVIRONMENT=development`
3. **Deploy to Production**: Ensure all security measures are in place
4. **Monitor Performance**: Use built-in monitoring and alerting

## Troubleshooting

- If tests fail, ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- For exchange connection issues, verify API credentials in `.env`
- For DeFi operations, ensure RPC endpoints are accessible
- Check logs for detailed error messages
